        <h2>Project background:</h2>
        <p>

            The project is part of "data science" class for 10th grade students of Tichonet's High School in Tel Aviv. <br />
            The project combines two main areas of knowledge: <br />
            - Programming in a web environment <br />
            - Data science <br />
            As part of the project, I located databases on the network and intend to build around them a website that allows access to the databases, data analysis and presentation to users in a convenient way.<br />
            The site will allow the user to explore the data in the chosen field and try to reach valuable insights and conclusions.
